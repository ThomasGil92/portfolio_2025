            I come from a background in the restaurant industry, and in 2018, I
            transitioned into web development. I started building my own
            projects following my studies in web development on Udemy and
            OpenClassrooms.

            With over fifteen clients under my belt, I contribute to the
            architecture of your projects, track your product needs, and develop
            your features.
